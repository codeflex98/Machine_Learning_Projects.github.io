# Bank Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a banking environment using various data analytics and machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and develop predictive models to mitigate it.

## Report Contents
The report covers the following sections:
1. **Introduction** - Understanding customer churn in banking.
2. **Data Description** - Overview of dataset features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Key insights and visualizations.
4. **Feature Engineering** - Data preprocessing and transformations.
5. **Model Building** - Machine learning models for prediction.
6. **Evaluation & Interpretation** - Model performance and insights.
7. **Conclusion & Recommendations** - Summary and strategic implications.
