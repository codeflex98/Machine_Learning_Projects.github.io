Star Wars Chatbot

```markdown
# 🌌 Star Wars Chatbot

A simple NLP-based chatbot themed around the Star Wars universe. This project uses Python, NLTK, and TensorFlow to classify user input and respond with appropriate, fan-friendly dialogue.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Intent-based conversation system using JSON
- Text preprocessing with tokenization and lemmatization
- Neural network for classifying user input
- Themed responses from the Star Wars universe
- Save/load trained models and data

├── starwars_chatbot.ipynb   # Main notebook
├── starwarsintents.json     # Dataset of intents and responses
├── chatbot_model.h5         # Trained model (after running notebook)
├── words.pkl                # Preprocessed vocabulary
├── classes.pkl              # Encoded intent classes

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy nltk tensorflow
```

The first time you run the notebook, it will also download NLTK resources:

```python
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starwars_chatbot.git
   cd starwars_chatbot
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook starwars_chatbot.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run all cells** to:
   - Load and preprocess data
   - Train the chatbot model
   - Test chatbot interaction

4. **Chat with the bot!**
   Use the chatbot interface at the end of the notebook to test responses.

## 📚 Data Format

The `starwarsintents.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hello", "Hi", "Hey"],
      "responses": ["Greetings, young Jedi.", "Hello there!"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

---

## 🤖 Example Interaction

```
User: Hello!
Bot: Hello there!

User: Tell me about the Force.
Bot: The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things.
```

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Add LSTM or Transformer-based model for better context handling
- Improve dataset with more diversified Star Wars dialogue
- Create a web-based UI for real-time interactions
