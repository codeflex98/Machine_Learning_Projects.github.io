# Lung Cancer Prediction App

This project is a machine learning-based application to predict the risk of lung cancer based on input features. The model is built using various health-related features, and the app is developed using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.

## Files

- **Lung_cancer_model.pkl**: This file contains the trained machine learning model used to predict lung cancer risk.
- **Lung_cancer_predi_app.py**: This file is the main Streamlit application that provides the user interface and connects to the model for making predictions.
- **Lung_cancer_Prediction.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing the development of the lung cancer prediction model.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the required dependencies to run the app.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lung-cancer-prediction.git
   cd lung-cancer-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

1. Make sure that you have all the dependencies installed.
2. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run Lung_cancer_predi_app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to use the app.

## Usage

- The app provides a user interface where you can input various health features such as gender, age, smoking status, and symptoms.
- Once you enter the values, click the "Predict" button to receive the lung cancer risk prediction.
  - If the prediction result is `1`, the app will display a message indicating a high risk of lung cancer.
  - If the prediction result is `0`, the app will display a message indicating a low risk of lung cancer.

## Example Inputs

- **Gender**: Select "Male" or "Female"
- **Age**: Enter an age between 18 and 100
- **Symptoms**: Select "Yes" or "No" for symptoms like fatigue, coughing, shortness of breath, etc.

## Model Details

- The machine learning model used is a classification model that predicts the likelihood of lung cancer based on the provided features.
- The model was trained using historical medical data and has been serialized into the `Lung_cancer_model.pkl` file.

## Requirements

To run the app, you will need the following Python packages:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `joblib`

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
